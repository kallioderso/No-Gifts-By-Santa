    Santa has fallen ill, and it’s already the first of December — so it’s your turn to save Christmas.
    Your task is to choose the perfect gifts for every person based on their likes and dislikes. Luckily, Santa’s workshop is packed with a huge variety of items. Pick great gifts to earn gingerbread, unlock even more exciting presents, and discover useful tools that make your job easier and even more fun.

<span style="font-size:2rem; font-weight:700;">🎄 About <em>No‑Gifts‑By‑Santa</em></span><br>
<p>
This game was created as our submission to the Flavortown Hack Club event, where the challenge was simply to create something.<br>
So we (Pascal Lösch and Lena Röder) decided to build a funny little Christmas game.<br>
After a quick brainstorming session, we came up with the idea:
</p>
<div style="padding: 0.6rem 1rem; background:#f7f7f7; border-left:4px solid #d33; margin:1rem 0;">
<strong>“What if Santa got ill, and now it’s our job to package all the missing gifts ourselves?”</strong>
</div>
From that spark, we developed the mechanics described below.
We hope you enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed making it — and that you have fun saving Christmas 😄<br>

<span style="font-size:1.8rem; font-weight:700;">🎁 Game Mechanics</span><br>
Every day from December 1st to December 24th, your mission is to package gifts so that every present is ready in time.<br>
The difficulty increases as the days go on.

To choose the right gifts, you receive a letter with information about each person.<br>
Your goal: pick the gift that matches their preferences as closely as possible.<br>
Each item has attributes such as:

<ul>
<li><strong>Color</strong></li>
<li><strong>Category</strong></li>
<li><strong>Age Group</strong></li>
<li><strong>Material</strong></li>
<li><strong>Usage</strong></li>
</ul>

Choose the best‑matching items while avoiding dislikes.<br>
The closer you get to the perfect gift, the more gingerbread you earn.<br>

You can spend gingerbread to unlock:
- A wider variety of items
- Useful tools that make your job easier and more fun


<div style="margin-top:1rem; padding:0.8rem; background:#fff3cd; border-left:4px solid #ffcc00;">
⚠️ <strong>But beware!</strong> Every 4 seconds, <strong>5 minutes</strong> of your workday pass — and your workday runs from <strong>9 AM to 8 PM</strong>.
Time is ticking!
</div><br>
